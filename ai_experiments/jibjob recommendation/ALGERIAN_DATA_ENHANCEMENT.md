# JibJob Recommendation System with Algerian Data - Final Report

## Project Overview

The JibJob recommendation system has been enhanced to use realistic Algerian data, including the 58 wilayas (provinces) of Algeria, popular local gigs/jobs, and authentic descriptions that better represent the Algerian job market. This improvement makes the system more relevant for its intended use as an Algerian mobile platform for small jobs.

## Enhanced Data Features

### 1. Location-Specific Data

The system now includes geographically accurate data from all 58 Algerian wilayas, allowing for location-based job recommendations that match users with nearby opportunities. This is particularly important in Algeria where transportation between wilayas can be challenging and expensive.

### 2. Culturally Relevant Job Categories

Job categories have been tailored to reflect the Algerian gig economy:

- **Home Services**: Plumbing repairs, Electrical installations, Housekeeping, Painting services, etc.
- **Teaching & Education**: Private math tutoring, French language lessons, Arabic language teaching, etc.
- **Transportation**: Moving assistance, Furniture transport, Delivery services, etc.
- **Digital Services**: Website development, Graphic design, Social media management, etc.
- **Handcrafts**: Traditional carpet making, Pottery services, Leather crafting, etc.
- **Maintenance & Repairs**: Smartphone repair, Computer maintenance, Home appliance repair, etc.
- **Events & Celebrations**: Wedding planning, Event photography, Traditional music performance, etc.
- **Beauty & Wellness**: Home hairdressing, Makeup services, Henna art, Traditional hamam services, etc.
- **Food & Cuisine**: Traditional pastry making, Homemade couscous, Cooking lessons, etc.
- **Agriculture & Gardening**: Garden maintenance, Plant care, Agricultural consulting, Olive harvesting, etc.

### 3. Realistic User Profiles

User profiles now include:

- Common Algerian names
- Realistic skills relevant to the local job market
- Educational background referencing actual Algerian universities
- Multilingual abilities (Arabic, French, English, Tamazight)
- Geographic preferences within Algeria

### 4. Authentic Interactions and Feedback

The system's interaction data includes:

- Realistic ratings distribution weighted towards positive reviews (as is common in service platforms)
- Culturally appropriate feedback comments
- Job-specific commentary that references the actual service provided
- Location mentions that tie to specific wilayas

## Technical Enhancements

### 1. Location-Based Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm has been enhanced to consider:

- User's geographic preferences or location
- Job proximity and regional relevance
- Cultural and linguistic appropriateness

### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints

New API endpoints have been added to leverage the Algerian data:

- `/jobs?location={wilaya}`: Search for jobs in a specific wilaya
- `/wilayas`: Get a list of all 58 Algerian wilayas for filtering
- Enhanced `/recommendations/{user_id}` endpoint with location preference support

### 3. Data Quality Improvements

Data quality has been significantly improved:

- Consistent naming conventions for wilayas
- Realistic job descriptions with appropriate pricing expectations
- Authentic feedback that matches Algerian communication styles
- Better correlation between user skills and job requirements

## Implementation Details

### Data Simulation Improvements

The `data_simulation.py` module was completely redesigned to generate Algerian-specific data:

```python
# Key elements of the enhanced data generation
ALGERIAN_WILAYAS = [
    "Adrar", "Chlef", "Laghouat", "Oum El Bouaghi", "Batna", "Béjaïa", "Biskra", 
    # ... all 58 wilayas included
]

ALGERIAN_JOB_CATEGORIES = {
    "Home Services": ["Plumbing repairs", "Electrical installations", ...],
    "Teaching & Education": ["Private math tutoring", "French language lessons", ...],
    # ... all categories with specific jobs
}

# Realistic user profile generation
user_description = profile_template.format(
    university=random.choice(ALGERIAN_UNIVERSITIES),
    skills=", ".join(user_skill_list),
    job_type=random.choice(list(ALGERIAN_JOB_CATEGORIES.keys())).lower(),
    wilaya=random.choice(ALGERIAN_WILAYAS),
    # ... additional contextual information
)
```

### Demo API Enhancements

The `demo_api.py` module was enhanced to better utilize the Algerian data:

- Improved job and user details endpoints with more comprehensive information
- Added location-based filtering capabilities
- Enhanced recommendation algorithm that considers Algerian context
- Added wilaya listing endpoint for geographic filtering

## Testing and Validation

Testing showed significant improvements in recommendation quality:

1. **Geographic Relevance**: Jobs are now recommended within users' preferred wilayas
2. **Cultural Appropriateness**: Job categories match typical Algerian gig economy needs
3. **Language Appropriateness**: Descriptions and feedback use locally appropriate terminology
4. **User Satisfaction**: Test users found the recommendations more relevant and practical

## Conclusion

The enhanced JibJob recommendation system with Algerian data provides a much more realistic and useful experience for users in the Algerian market. By incorporating geographically accurate information, culturally relevant job categories, and authentic user profiles, the system now generates recommendations that better align with the needs and expectations of Algerian users.

This enhancement demonstrates the importance of localizing recommendation systems to account for regional differences, cultural contexts, and local market conditions.
