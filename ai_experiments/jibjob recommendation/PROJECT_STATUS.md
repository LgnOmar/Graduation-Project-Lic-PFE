# JibJob Recommendation System - Project Status

## Cleanup Complete

The project has been successfully cleaned up, removing all temporary files and scripts related to image generation. The project now contains only the essential files needed for documentation, understanding, and running the recommendation system.

## Project Structure

The cleaned project now contains:

1. **Documentation**
   - `JibJob_Recommendation_System_Explained.md`: Pedagogical document for beginners
   - `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical details for advanced users
   - `USAGE_GUIDE.md`: Instructions for running the system
   - `FINAL_REPORT.md`: Overall summary of the project
   - `rapport_ameliore.tex`: Enhanced LaTeX report with proper images

2. **Images**
   - All diagram images are properly saved as PNG files in the `images/` directory
   - The LaTeX report correctly references these images

3. **Source Code**
   - Complete implementation in the `src/` directory
   - Data processing and simulation
   - Feature engineering with sentiment analysis
   - Graph construction and GCN model
   - Recommendation API

4. **Data and Models**
   - Sample data in the `data/` directory
   - Trained models in the `models/` directory

## Next Steps

The documentation is complete, and the project is ready for:

1. **Deployment**: The recommendation system can be deployed to production
2. **Further Development**: New features can be added as outlined in the future improvements section
3. **Maintenance**: The codebase is clean and well-documented for future maintenance

## Conclusion

The JibJob recommendation system project is now complete and ready for use. The documentation provides clear explanations of how the system works, from beginner-friendly overviews to detailed technical specifications. The codebase is well-structured and includes all necessary components for an end-to-end recommendation solution.
